# Proposal
What do a school of fish, a drove of sheep and a flight of birds have in common? As a group they all coordinate their movement and show _emergent behavior_; they shoal and they flock.

How are these animals able to do that majestic feat, continously changing direction, avoiding collisions and still form a coherent group? Are they telepaticly linked? Is there an unseen force that drives them? Or is it something much more mundane?

[Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/) was one of the first that come up with an algorithm to simulate these animal behaviors. Reynolds named his virtual creatures _boids_ and let them follow a few simple rules. From these rules his boids showed similar behavior as seen in fish, sheep and birds.

In this workshop you will recreate Reynolds algorithm, and you will do so on projected canvas sharing the habitat with other kind of boids.
